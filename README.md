# React TypeScript Search and Map Viewer

This project is a React and TypeScript-based application developed as a test exercise to practice React concepts inspired by the project app used in the "Modern React with Redux" course on Udemy. The application allows users to search for places and view their corresponding location on an interactive map powered by OpenStreetMap.

## Features

- **Search functionality**: Users can search for places by name.
- **OpenStreetMap integration**: Displays the location of a place on a map after performing a search.
- **React and TypeScript**: Built with React for the frontend and TypeScript for type safety.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **OpenStreetMap**: Collaborative mapping platform used for the map.
- **Leaflet**: A JavaScript library to embed interactive maps.

## Purpose

This project was created as a way to enhance my skills in React and TypeScript while working with third-party APIs (such as OpenStreetMap). It's a learning project designed to demonstrate how to implement search functionality and map rendering.

## Installation
- **Step 1**: Clones the repository to your local machine.
- **Step 2**: Navigates into the project directory.
- **Step 3**: Installs the required dependencies using `npm install`.
- **Step 4**: Starts the development server using `npm start` to run the application locally and have fun.
